/**
 * Admin, as a screen of its own.
 *
 * It sits directly below Settings in the sheet's page list — beside
 * Leaderboard, the other org-wide page — rather than inside Settings, because
 * it is not a knob on this app: it is a view of the whole company, and the
 * people who have it reach for it as a destination.
 *
 * THE WAY OUT LIVES HERE, and it is one step back — not one jump out. The
 * screen carries the same Back every other sheet-reached page does
 * (Leaderboard, Heartbeat), in the same place, with the same chevron. But
 * admin has pages inside it — a section, a person, one of their
 * conversations — and a Back that always left for chat stranded an admin
 * three levels deep: the person and the transcript they had open were gone.
 * So the screen keeps a history of where it has been (see adminNav.ts), and
 * Back pops one page; only at the root, with nothing left to pop, does it
 * leave admin for chat.
 *
 * The panel's own drill links ("All people", "Back to this person") pop the
 * SAME stack. One history, however the admin asks to go back.
